# A Convolutional Neural Network for predicting HIV Integration Sites
This repository contains python notebooks used for training a CNN to predict proviral HIV integration sites in the human genome. The notebooks use datasets generated by the [Retrovirus Integration Database Parser & Training Set Generator](https://github.com/senadmd/RetrovirusIntegrationDatabaseParser).
This repository is part of a degree project written by Senad Matuh Delic (full-text link to be added).

## Getting Started

This repository contains multiple python notebooks that use [Keras API](https://keras.io/) to create a convolutional neural network for predicting HIV integration sites. The main notebook is [HIV_Provirus_CNN.ipynb]() while the other notebooks are attempts at improving the performance of the main neural network design.  

The python notebooks can be executed on a machine having Tensorflow installed, or in Google Colaboratory [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/senadmd/HIVProvirusIntegrationPrediction/HIV_Provirus_CNN.ipynb] with GPU runtime.

### Prerequisites

To run this project you need [Tensorflow 1.15.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/) with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Biopython 1.76](https://biopython.org/).

## Performance and comparison
In attempt at improving the performance of CNN developed in the notebook [HIV_Provirus_CNN.ipynb](), we have modified the neural network design with the addition L2 regularization and layers performing batch normalization. By adding batch normalization, one will see that the neural network performs better on the training set, but this improvement is not reflected on the validation data as shown below. The addition of L2 regularization did not improve the performance of model at all. 

| Notebook | Validation Loss | Validation Accuracy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [HIV_Provirus_CNN.ipynb]()  | 0.4643 | 0.7786|
| [HIV_Provirus_CNN_BatchNormalizationAndL2.ipynb]() | 0.6289 | 0.7069 |
| [HIV_Provirus_CNN_L2Regularization.ipynb]() | 0.6266 | 0.6880 |
| [HIV_Provirus_CNN_BatchNormalization.ipynb]() | 0.7883 | 0.6467 |
